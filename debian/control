Description: The simECG software was developed for acting as an ECG simulator,
 for both training and assessment purposes.
 It has the ability to display several pre-defined rhythms for training purposes,
 such as rhythm and conduction disturbances. Additionally, a number of settings
 can be altered in order to create different training experiences for different
 levels of user proficiency. With the release of this version, in Open Source
 format, the authors putin practical application their ideal that education (and
 training, in this case) should not be a commercial tool accessible to some but
 rather a free collaborative tool available for those who seek knowledge.This
 project will always be unfinished, and for that reason we count with your
 comments and feedback to improve it. Please write you feedback by mail or place
 in the forum.
